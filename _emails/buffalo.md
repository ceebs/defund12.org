subject: Buffalo, NY Resident for Defunding the BPD
body: "My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident of Buffalo. The incident as reported by WBFO (NPR) on June 4, 2020 is appalling and inhumane. This is a display of egregious police brutality. Please watch the video if you are not familiar: [video link](https://twitter.com/wbfo/status/1268712530358292484). This should speak for itself in justifying the immediate need to defund the BPD.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
