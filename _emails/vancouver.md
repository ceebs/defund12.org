  To the City of Vancouver elected officials:

  My name is \[YOUR NAME\] and I am writing to you today to express my absolute outrage regarding the Vancouver Police Department 2020 Budget of $315,278,281.00 or 21% of the total operational budget for the City of Vancouver. This astronomical police budget is unacceptable and requires serious action. The 1% budget cut voted on by Council on May 14th, 2020 is simply not enough. I call upon our elected officials to start divesting from the inherently violent institution that is the Vancouver Police Department immediately.

  I am asking that you, as an elected official, pledge to do the following:

  1. To never again vote to increase the Vancouver Police Department budget.

  2. To propose and implement a Vancouver Police Department budget cut of, at the absolute minimum, $152 million in accordance with the City of Vancouver’s operating budget shortfall projections due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

  3. To prioritize the expansion of community-led health and safety initiatives over future financial investment into the Vancouver Police Department.

  In the face of cyclical police violence happening throughout North America right now, there is no better time to commit ourselves to change. What we need in Vancouver is leadership that can initiate reform that aims towards the eventual abolition of police and prisons - and, in turn, the immense police violence that targets our most marginalized people. An increased police presence does not keep us safe, rather it directly threatens the lives of our most vulnerable communities (BIPOC, the LGBTQ2S+ community, unhoused people in the DTES, street-based sex workers, people with disabilities, people experiencing poverty, etc). It is impossible to effectively reform the police to protect the marginalized communities they were designed to target, therefore, we must choose to transition towards abolition. Instead of investing in the police, our city must prioritize alternatives like education, increased mental health services, housing initiatives, income security, harm reduction services, accessible rehabilitation, mutual aid, social workers, conflict resolution services, transformative justice, and other vital community-based support systems. These initiatives must support our most vulnerable communities and centre the experiences of Black and Indigenous peoples in Vancouver. I suggest consulting with the Hogan's Alley Society, Black Lives Matter, Vancouver Aboriginal Transformative Justice Services Society, Battered Women’s Support Services, WISH Drop-In Centre Society, and the Carnegie Community Action Project for effective ways to redistribute our tax dollars and effect actual change in keeping communities safe. I'm asking that our city is among the first to eradicate the notion that human beings are disposable and that harmful policing is the only solution to the many issues we face as a community. We must create a better future for all, not just for the most privileged among us.

  Sincerely,

  \[YOUR NAME\]
